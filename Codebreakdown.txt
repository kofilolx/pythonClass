The simulation is a numerical approach to solving the heat transfer equation for a solid with a given heat capacity. 
The solid is placed in an environment with a temperature Te, and heat is transferred from the environment to the solid over time. 
The rate of heat transfer is described by the equation dQ/dt = -k * A * (T - Te) / d, 
where k is the thermal conductivity of the solid, A is its surface area, d is its thickness, and T is its temperature.

The simulation runs from t=0 to tfinal with a time step dt, and the initial temperature is T0. For each iteration of the simulation, 
the heat input dQ is calculated using dQ = -dQdt * dt, and the temperature of the solid is updated using T = T + dQdt * dt. 
This allows us to track how the temperature of the solid changes over time as heat is transferred from the environment to the solid.

Finally, by plotting the temperature of the solid versus the heat input, 
the specific heat capacity Cp can be extracted from the slope of the plot, 
giving us Cp = dQ/dT/V, where V is the volume of the solid.
